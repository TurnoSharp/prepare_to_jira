# settings for mysql before connecting to Jira

# find the configuration file mysqld.cnf and add the following lines:

[mysqld]
...
default-storage-engine=INNODB
innodb_default_row_format=DYNAMIC
innodb_log_file_size=2G
sql_mode = NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO

where:

default-storage-engine - defines the mechanism for storing data in the table by default (it will be used if it is not explicitly specified using ENGINE when creating the table).
    
innodb_default_row_format - The default row format (it will be used if not specified explicitly with ROW_FORMAT).

innodb_log_file_size - redo log size for fixing data change operations. The larger its value, the better the performance of the server by reducing disk operations. Too large a value consumes a lot of memory.

sql_mode - SQL mode. In this example, when receiving a value of 0 for a field with auto_increment, the system will treat it exactly as 0.

and restart mysql.service
